ProAngular 9 book by Adam Freeman 2020 (chapters 7, 8, 9, 10)

I will create an online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page, a shopping cart
where users can add and remove products, and a checkout where customers can enter their shipping details
and place their orders. I will also create an administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete
(CRUD) facilities for managing the catalogâ€”and I will protect it so that only logged-in administrators can
make changes. Finally, I show you how to prepare and deploy an Angular application.
